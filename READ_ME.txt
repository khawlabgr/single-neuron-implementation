                                         One Neuron Model - Python Implementation
                                      ----------------------------------------------
## Project Description

This project presents a basic neural network model with only one neuron.
It is designed to introduce the fundamental principles of deep learning, activation functions, loss computation, and training processes using Python.

The goal is to demonstrate how a simple neuron can learn from data by adjusting its weight and bias using gradient descent.
